Last december a few friends of mine organized an event called *Floripa IT Solidary Christmas*. It was a week long event, with a different technology workshop each day. All the organizers and instructors were volunteers and the whole R$ 1,500.00 of revenue gathered with the fees was used to buy food for people in need. In total, we gathered R$ 1,100.00! I was invited to give a Python workshop and I was really happy with the opportunity. I decided to give an introductory workshop on Python aimed at people that already knew how to program in any language.

There were five workshops in different areas. The full schedule was:

- Monday - **Less meetings and more post-its: Kanban in practice** by Rodrigo Vieira (Bravi)
- Tuesday - **Scrum: Building successful teams** by Gabriel Vieira (Evolução Ágil)
- Wednesday - **Delegation board: Agile organizations and management 3.0** by Antonio Campos and Danilo Garcia (Createfy)
- Thursday - **Test-Drive Development (TDD) in Practice** by Jonathan Henrique de Souza (ArcTouch)
- Friday - **First steps with Python** by Matheus Braun Magrin (Bravi)

As the intended audience for my workshop were people that already knew how to program I could skip the basic programming principles and jumped right into the main aspects of Python itself. I have covered:

- Python's philoshopy and it's community
- Basics of the syntax
- Some of the built-in types and data structures
- String formatting
- Sequence slicing
- Control structures
- Functions (regular and anonymous)
- Classes and method naming convetions
- Comprehension, generators and iterators
- Decorators
- Exception handling
- Monkey patching
- How to ask for help in the interpreter
- Virtualenvs
- Some examples from different areas, namely data science, web development and automation

For the hands on part of the workshop we used [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). It's a platform were people can learn new programming languages through challenges, which they call kata. I have put together a collection of 31 beginner Python katas and during the workshop the students went through several of these challenges. The collection is available [here](https://www.codewars.com/collections/basic-python).
