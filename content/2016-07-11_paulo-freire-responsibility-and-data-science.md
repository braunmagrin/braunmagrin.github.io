I'd like to start this post (and this blog) with a quote:

> "(...) The more I train myself as a professional, the more I systematize my
> experiences, the more I make use of the cultural heritage, which is everyone's
> heritage and to which everyone must serve, the more my responsibility with the
> men increases."[^1]

This is a free translation of a Paulo Freire's[^2] quote from "Education and change".
This expresses how I've been feeling about all the cool things I've learned so
far. In fact, I did almost all of my education for free. I've studied in public
schools and in a public university, which were paid by everyone. And nowadays I've
been using a lot of freely available online resources. It's about time to start sharing
and hopefully help other people to learn as well.


## Why I've choosen a blog?

I've chosen to do so in a blog because it's an flexible medium. It allows for several
types of content. The blog format also suits my other objectives, which are:

 - to keep a lerning log, so that I can revisit stuff that I've learned; and
 - improve my writing skills, both in Portuguese, my mother tongue, and in English.


## Who am I?

I'm a Brazilian. I currently work as a Data Scientist at [Bravi](http://www.bravi.com.br),
where we build a Learning Analytics platform. I've studied Computer Science in college.
Today the tools I use and like the most are Python, the SciPy stack and Jupyter Notebooks.

I aspire to be an educator. Unfortunately, the specific subject is yet to be decided.
I keep changing my mind from technology and data science related areas to something related
to Permaculture and sustainable living.

I really like the whole [FLOSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html)
idea. Actually, I also like other "Open" things, like Open Science, Open Access, Open
Data, Open Education and so on. I really think that the knowledge and technologies
should benefit everyone and one great way of doing so is to the make them publicly
available.


## What is this blog about?

Here you can expect to see posts about a lot of topics. When I was still thinking if
I would create this blog I listed the topics I like, and therefore, that I would like
to study and share with you. I've created a mind map that you can see below. I guess
it'll take a while, but someday I'll talk about them all.

mais sistematizo minhas experiências, quanto mais me utilizo do patrimônio cultural,
que é patrimônio de todos e ao qual todos devem servir, mais aumenta minha
responsabilidade com os homens." Paulo Freire in Educação e Mudança, p.20

[^2]: Paulo Freire is a Brazilian educator. Arguably one of the most influential,
at least one of the most cited ones according to [this study](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/12/what-are-the-most-cited-publications-in-the-social-sciences-according-to-google-scholar/).
